## Overview
- This project idea came from [Comma-AI's Speed Challenge](https://github.com/commaai/speedchallenge). The goal is to predict the speed of car from dashcam footage.

* **data/train.mp4** is a video of driving containing 20400 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.
- data/train.txt contains the speed of the car at each frame, one speed on each line.
- data/test.mp4 is a different driving video containing 10798 frames. Video is shot at 20 fps.
